# Argument Child Command Design

## Context

CommandLib originally modeled command trees as either command children or a
linear argument chain:

```text
/root
/root child
/root child <argument>
/root <argument>
/root <argument> <argument>
```

Minecraft's Brigadier tree also allows a literal command node under an argument
node:

```text
/root <argument> child
/root <argument> child <argument>
```

This design note records how CommandLib represents that shape, how the fluent
API is expected to behave, and which internal boundaries are intentional.

## Goals

- Allow an `Argument` node to have one or more child `Command` nodes.
- Keep the user-facing API chainable:

  ```java
  argument(n, p)
      .description("...")
      .execute((nValue, pValue, ctx) -> {
      })
      .child((nArg, pArg) -> new Command("sub") {{
      }});
  ```

- Let child commands read parent arguments in a typed way:

  ```java
  Integer n = ctx.getArgument(nArg);
  ```

- Keep internal tree storage types out of the public API where possible.
- Preserve the existing command/argument execution behavior for literal-first
  commands.

## Non-Goals

- This is not intended to make argument-first command design the default
  recommendation. Literal-first command shapes are still easier to read for most
  plugin commands.
- This does not introduce a separate Brigadier abstraction layer. The existing
  `CommonCommand`, `Arguments`, and `CommandNodeCreator` model remains the source
  of truth.
- This does not require a raw-input parse fallback for parent arguments.
  Brigadier can resolve parent arguments in argument-child trees after
  `CommandExecutor` rebuilds the root context.

## Public API Shape

`CommonCommand#argument(...)` returns an `ArgumentBranch` object. The branch is a
configuration handle for the argument chain that was just registered.

Typed overloads return arity-specific branch classes:

- `UnaryArgumentBranch`
- `BiArgumentBranch`
- `TriArgumentBranch`
- `TetraArgumentBranch`
- `QuintArgumentBranch`
- `HexaArgumentBranch`
- `HeptArgumentBranch`

These classes exist so the branch can expose typed `execute(...)` and typed
child factories:

```java
IntegerArgument n = new IntegerArgument("n");
PlayerArgument p = new PlayerArgument("p");

argument(n, p)
    .

execute((parsedN, parsedP, ctx) ->{
        })
        .

child((nArg, pArg) ->new

Command("sub") {
    {
        execute(ctx -> {
            Integer parsedN = ctx.getArgument(nArg);
            Player parsedP = ctx.getArgument(pArg);
        });
    }
});
```

The child factory receives `CommonArgument` instances, not parsed values. Parsed
values do not exist when the command tree is being constructed; they only exist
when an executor runs.

## Why `child` Instead of `command`

The method is named `child(...)` because this API mutates the command tree by
adding a child node under the current argument branch. It also matches the
existing `addChildren(...)` and `children()` vocabulary.

`command(...)` was considered, but it is less precise in this API because
`Command` is both a type and a root/subcommand concept. `child(...)` reads as a
tree operation and keeps the DSL aligned with the rest of CommandLib.

## Internal Model

### `Arguments`

`Arguments` represents one argument chain owned by a command. It stores:

- the ordered `CommonArgument` list
- child commands attached to the terminal argument node
- an optional help description for the chain

For example:

```text
/a <n> <p> sub
```

is represented as:

```text
Command: a
  Arguments: <n> <p>
    Children:
      Command: sub
```

`Arguments` is intentionally package-private. It is an internal storage type,
not a user-facing API.

### `ArgumentBranch`

`ArgumentBranch` is the public configuration handle returned from
`argument(...)`.

It delegates the actual mutation to an `ArgumentBranchDelegate`:

```java
description(...)

execute(...)

child(...)

children(...)
```

The branch does not directly store `Arguments`. This keeps `Arguments` from
becoming public just because branch classes live in their own package.

### `ArgumentBranchDelegate`

`ArgumentBranchDelegate` is a narrow bridge from the public `branch` package back
to the internal `CommonCommand`/`Arguments` model.

It has only the operations needed by `ArgumentBranch`:

```java
void description(String description);

void execute(CommandHandler<C> action);

void addChildren(Collection<? extends T> children);
```

`CommonCommand` creates the delegate for a specific `Arguments` instance. This
keeps the package split clean:

- `net.kunmc.lab.commandlib.branch`: public branch API
- `net.kunmc.lab.commandlib`: internal command model and tree mutation

## Child Addition Flow

For a typed branch:

```java
argument(n, p).

child((nArg, pArg) ->new

Command("sub") {
    {
    }
});
```

the flow is:

1. `CommonCommand#argument(n, p)` creates and stores an `Arguments` instance.
2. `CommonCommand` creates an `ArgumentBranchDelegate` bound to that
   `Arguments`.
3. `BiArgumentBranch` stores the two `CommonArgument` instances.
4. `BiArgumentBranch#child(...)` calls the factory with those argument
   instances.
5. The produced command is passed to `ArgumentBranch#child(...)`.
6. `ArgumentBranch` calls `delegate.addChildren(...)`.
7. `CommonCommand#addArgumentChildren(...)` validates the children, stores them
   in `Arguments`, and assigns parent metadata.

The parent metadata is important. An argument-child command has both:

- `parent`: the owning command
- `parentArguments`: the argument chain under which it was attached

Without `parentArguments`, help generation cannot reconstruct:

```text
/a <n> <p> sub
```

from the `sub` command alone.

## Multiple Children

The same argument branch can receive multiple children:

```java
argument(n, p)
    .

child((nArg, pArg) ->new

Command("sub") {
    {
    }
})
        .

child((nArg, pArg) ->new

Command("sub2") {
    {
    }
});
```

Internally this appends both commands to the same `Arguments#children` list:

```text
Arguments: <n> <p>
  Children:
    sub
    sub2
```

The resulting Brigadier tree is:

```text
a
  <n>
    <p>
      sub
      sub2
```

## Brigadier Node Creation

`CommandNodeCreator` converts the internal model into Brigadier nodes.

When an argument chain has children, the child command nodes are attached to the
terminal argument node:

```text
a
  <n>
    <p>
      sub
```

The key detail is that child commands inherit the argument chain that was parsed
before the literal child:

```java
List<Arguments<C>> executorArguments = appendArgument(inheritedArguments, arguments);
```

That inherited list is passed to child command creation so child executors parse
both:

- parent argument chains
- their own argument chains

This is what allows:

```text
/config difficulty set hard
```

to parse both `difficulty` and `hard`.

## Execution and Argument Parsing

`CommandExecutor` parses a list of `Arguments`, not just a single chain. That is
required because an argument-child command may need to parse parent arguments and
child arguments.

For argument-child commands, `CommandExecutor` rebuilds the Brigadier context
from the root before creating the CommandLib context. This is important because
Brigadier may split command execution context across parent/child command
contexts. Rebuilding from the root gives CommandLib a context that can resolve
the full executed command path.

Because of that, parent arguments can be read through the normal argument
implementation:

```java
Integer n = ctx.getArgument(nArg);
```

No raw-input fallback is required for the current implementation. If a future
change removes or changes root context rebuilding, argument-child parsing should
be revalidated with tests before adding any fallback behavior.

## Help Generation

Help output must include the full usage path for argument-child commands.

For root help:

```text
/a <n> <p> sub <b>
/a <n> <p> sub <float> sub
```

For help triggered inside `sub`, the prefix still needs to include the parent
arguments:

```text
/a <n> <p> sub <b>
```

`parentArguments` is used to reconstruct these prefixes. Help generation also
keeps normal children and argument children in one usage list; separating them
would imply a semantic distinction that does not exist in the command tree.

Descriptions are emitted in two places:

- command description before `Usage:`
- argument branch description after the usage line

Snapshot tests intentionally keep color codes because color is part of the
user-facing help contract.

## Tests

The common test suite should cover the shared behavior. Important cases:

- argument chain can have a child command
- argument-child command can have its own arguments
- child command can read parent arguments after child arguments are parsed
- the same argument branch can have multiple children
- help snapshots for:
    - root command input
    - parent arguments typed
    - child literal typed
    - child argument typed
    - command descriptions

Avoid tests that simulate impossible Brigadier behavior by making a custom
argument always fail. If a test exists to justify a parsing fallback, it should
use a real Brigadier command tree shape that fails without that fallback.

## Design Constraints

- Keep `Arguments` package-private unless there is a strong reason to expose it.
- Keep branch classes in `net.kunmc.lab.commandlib.branch` to avoid crowding the
  root package.
- Prefer arity-prefix names (`BiArgumentBranch`, `TriArgumentBranch`) over
  numbered names (`ArgumentBranch2`, `ArgumentBranch3`).
- Keep comments focused on why tree inheritance, help prefix reconstruction, or
  context rebuilding is needed.

## Open Questions

- Whether `ArgumentBranchDelegate` should remain public. It is public because
  `ArgumentBranch` has a public constructor, but it is not intended for typical
  library users.
- Whether `childCommand(...)` should be added as an alias for readability. The
  current recommendation is to keep only `child(...)` unless user confusion
  appears in real usage.
- Whether help ordering should remain insertion order or use a more explicit
  ordering policy. Current behavior follows insertion order where possible.
